   <h1>Splitting Names</h1>

   <p>To help personalise our mailshots we want to have the first name and last name 
      of the customer. 
      Unfortunately the customer data that we are supplied only contains full names.</p>

   <p>The system therefore attempts to break a supplied full name into its constituents by 
      splitting around whitespace.</p>

   <h3>Example</h3>

   <p>The full name John Smith will be broken into first name John and last name Smith.</p>
