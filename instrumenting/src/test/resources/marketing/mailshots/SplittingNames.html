        <h1>Splitting Names</h1>

        <p>
            To help personalise our mailshots we want to have the first name
            and last name of the customer. Unfortunately the customer data
            that we are supplied only contains full names.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system therefore attempts to break a supplied full name into
            its constituents by splitting around whitespace.
        </p>

        <div class="example">

            <h3>Example</h3>

            <p>
                The full name <span>Jane Smith</span> will be <span>broken</span>span>
                into first name <span>Jane</span> and last name <span>Smith</span>.
            </p>
